### Captive portal hijacking

#### Instructions:
Read/download `download.sh`, this is a simple bash script that can be copy+pasted into a terminal or simply ran from the terminal. 

Once downloaded, change the file to be executable:
`
sudo chmod +x download.sh
`

And run with:
`./download.sh
`

The file will download the required repositories, software, and start the captive portal session hijack attempt. 

As each network differs slightly, it would be best practise to test at different times to ensure you can hijack a session anytime.
